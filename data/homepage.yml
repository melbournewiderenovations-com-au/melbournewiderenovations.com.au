            We follow a systematic approach to ensure your bathroom renovation is seamless and efficient. Hereâ€™s what
            you can expect:
            Consultation and Planning: We start with an in-depth consultation to discuss your ideas, needs, and budget. Our designers will create a detailed plan, including layout, materials, and fixtures, for your approval. Design and Selection: Once the plan is finalized, we help you choose the perfect materials, colors, and
            finishes to bring your vision to life. We provide samples and expert advice to ensure every detail is just
            right. Demolition and Preparation: Our team carefully removes the old fixtures and prepares the space for
            renovation. We take precautions to protect your home and minimize disruption during this phase. Construction and Installation: With the space prepared, our craftsmen begin the construction and
            installation process. We handle everything from plumbing and electrical work to tiling, cabinetry, and
            fixture installation. Finishing Touches: After the major work is completed, we focus on the finishing touches that make your
            bathroom special. This includes painting, trim work, and installing accessories. Final Inspection and Handover: We conduct a thorough inspection to ensure everything meets our high
            standards and your satisfaction. Once approved, we clean the area and present your newly renovated
            bathroom, ready for you to enjoy."
